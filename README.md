# Weather App

This app provides you with real-time weather information for any location. This application was built with React and it fetches data from a weather API (https://openweathermap.org/)


## Key Features
* A search input field that allows you to search by city 
* A responsive user-friendly User interface that displays the current temperature, weather description, and other details.
* A toggle switch for switching between dark and light mood


### Technologies Used

* React JS
* Tailwind CSS
* Axios
  
### What I Learnt 
I've been struggling to understand how useContext and useReducer work in React. This project gave me the opportunity to work with them. Now I have a better understanding of how to work with context API. 

Furthermore, I learned how to implement the light and dark moods which I have not done before until I built this project

Conclusively, this project exposed me to reading API documentation. Navigating and reading through https://openweathermap.org/ was a challenging but exciting journey, and I look forward to reading more documentation as I build more systems.
